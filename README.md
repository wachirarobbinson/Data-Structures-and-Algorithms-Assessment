## Stacks: Question 1 - is_balanced

The `is_balanced` function checks whether a given expression containing parentheses,
curly braces, and square brackets is balanced. An expression is considered balanced 
if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

## Sequences: Question 2 - remove_duplicates

The remove_duplicates function takes a sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence
with duplicates removed while maintaining the original order of elements.

## Dictionaries: Question 3 - word_frequency

The word_frequency function takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency
of each word in the sentence. It ignores punctuation and considers words in a case-insensitive manner.
